# fhchaos home

## What is this?
This is the page that will be displayed when you visit [fhchaos][1], Felix' and
Hans' little server. Sometimes people end up there by accident, because they
mistyped a URL and the server is configured to respond to every subdomain that
is not explicitly configured, e.g. [http://notconfigured.diskurswelt.de/][2].

## Usage
If you happen to need a similar page on your server, feel free to use this
little webpage of ours and modify it to your needs. It is published under [MIT
license][3] (see MITLICENSE).
